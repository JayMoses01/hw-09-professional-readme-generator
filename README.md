# Homework 09: Professional README Generator


## Description

I created a README Markdown file generator with this functionality:

* Upon running "node index.js" in the command line, the user is prompted for information necessary for generating their README file.
* The following sections will generate containing the user's input:
    * Description
    * Table of Contents
    * Installation
    * Usage
    * License
    * Contributing
    * Tests
    * Questions
* The license that the user selects determines the license badge that displays towards the top of the generated README file, and it also determines the license-related legal text that is populated in the "License" section.
* The user is prompted to enter their GitHub username, GitHub profile URL, and email address. This information is added to the "Questions" section with instructions on how to reach the user with questions.
* The generated README file also contains a functional Table of Contents with links that allow a user to navigate directly to their desired section by clicking on the respective section link.
